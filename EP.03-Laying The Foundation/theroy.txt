The type attribute specifies the type of script inside the <script> tag. Options include "text/javascript", "text/ecmascript", "module", "text/babel", and "text/typescript".

- {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX.
{TitleComponent}: Represents a JavaScript expression or variable.
{<TitleComponent/>}: Represents a component returning JSX.
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}: Represents a component with child components enclosed within the opening and closing tags.
