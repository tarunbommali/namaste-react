-What is the difference between Named export, Default export, and * as export?
 
    Named export: Allows you to export multiple named values from a module and
    import them individually by their names in other files.
    // Module.js
    export const name = 'John';
    export const age = 30;
    // OtherFile.js
    import { name, age } from './Module';


    Default export: Used to export a single value from a module. When importing,
    you can give it any name.
    // Module.js
    const name = 'John';
    export default name;
    // OtherFile.js
    import newName from './Module';


- * as export: Imports all exported values from a module and assigns them to a single object.
Useful for importing multiple exports at once.
    // Module.js
    export const name = 'John';
    export const age = 30;
    // OtherFile.js
    import * as details from './Module';


- What is the importance of config.js file?
The config.js file is important for storing configuration settings, constants, or 
environment variables in one central place. It helps in maintaining and managing 
configuration options for the entire application, making it easier to update settings 
without modifying multiple files.

Q: What are React Hooks?
React Hooks are functions that enable you to use state and other React features in 
functional components. They allow you to add state and lifecycle methods to functional 
components without using class components.

Q: Why do we need useState Hook?
The useState Hook in React is used to add state to functional components. It allows
functional components to have their own state, making them capable of storing and 
updating data. This is important for managing component state without converting 
functional components to class components.
